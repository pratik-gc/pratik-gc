Hi there ğŸ‘‹, Welcome to my profile!

I am Pratik Chaudhari from Pune, India. I am currently pursuing my Post-Graduation Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC) Course from CDAC-ACTS Pune in March 2023 batch.

I am here to share my work with the world. Soon, I would like to contribute to open source projects to help our community in a productive way.

On personal front, I am a beginner in learning Portuguese and German languages. I am planning to learn Spanish as well in near future.

=> ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
=> ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React JS and .NET.
